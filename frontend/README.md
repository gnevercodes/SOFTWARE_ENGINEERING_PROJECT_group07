# CREATE react app 

- this project was bootstrapped using [create react app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

# Scripts to be executed 

- in the project directory you will be able to run :

### `npm start`

this will allow us to run our app in a development phase mode which only allow us to view our website on a local website displaying it only on our browser.\
like open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to be able to view it on our browser. 

this will continuously reload whenever you make any changes making it effective at once. 
the errors will be clearly depicted in the console . 

### `npm test`

This action will initiate the test runner, allowing you to run your tests efficiently. Specifically, it launches the test runner in an interactive watch mode, which enables you to observe test results in real time as you make changes to your code. For further details on how to run tests effectively, please refer to the section on [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests). This resource provides comprehensive guidance and insights to help you get the most out of your testing process.


### `npm run build`
This command compiles the application for production and places the output in the `build` folder. It efficiently bundles React in production mode, optimizing the build to ensure peak performance.

The resulting build is minified, and the filenames are hashed for better cache management. Your application is now prepared for deployment!

For further details on how to deploy your app, please consult the section on [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).


### `npm run eject`
The command `npm run eject` is used in Create React App projects to "eject" the configuration settings that are hidden by default. Here's what it does:

 **Access to Configuration**: By running this command, you gain direct access to the configuration files for tools like Webpack, Babel, ESLint, and others that are otherwise abstracted away. This allows for deeper customization of the build process.

 **One-Way Operation**: Ejecting is a one-way operation; once you eject, you cannot go back to the original setup. This means you take on the responsibility of maintaining and updating these configurations.
 
 **Use Cases**: Ejecting is beneficial if you need specific configurations that are not supported out of the box. For example, if you need to modify the Webpack configuration to add custom loaders or plugins.

**Increased Complexity** : Keep in mind that ejecting increases the complexity of your project. You'll need to handle updates and troubleshooting for the configurations yourself.
